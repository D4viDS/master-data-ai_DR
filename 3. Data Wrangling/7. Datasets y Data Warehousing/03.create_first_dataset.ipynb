The next step is to clean up the clusters manually. This means moving the misclassified images into the correct folders and merging folders with identical letters. After this step we also should name the folders according to their content. Below is an example of how it should look like. As you can see there are usually upper- and lower-case letters found in the images. Since we cannot have folders with the same name we will use _ to denote the upper-case letters. Also, there are some cases in which two letters become one. For example, the letter sequence \"ck\" is not separated by any white space and will always be detected by the detection algorithm as one contour so we will create a folder called \"ck\" to account for this. <br>\n","**Note: We will create all of this folders within a folder called \"data\".**\n","<br>\n","![Overview of extracted images](https://github.com/akcarsten/cook_book/blob/master/images/readme/04.png?raw=1)\n","<br>\n","So, the final step to wrap all of this up is to convert the dataset into the IDX format. You might be familiar with this format already as the famous MNIST dataset is saved in the same way. Only in this case instead of reading the data from an IDX file we must write it.\n","<br>\n","We will do so by using the [idx_converter](https://github.com/akcarsten/convert_IDX) which takes a file structure as we set it up in this notebook and directly saves it in the IDX format. The output will be two files: one file with the images and a second file with the labels.\n","<br>\n","Since we want to later train a classifier on the data, we should already split the images into a training and a test dataset. For this we will move 30% of the images in each category to a test folder. The code below takes care of all of this. All of the below folders will be within a folder called \"data\" within this repository.
