You don't have to give the answer 400...it might be better to create something that predicts the number 4, and then your answer is in the 'hundreds of thousands' etc."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yB8hcFWm7N7i"},"outputs":[],"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","import numpy as np\n","from tensorflow import keras"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"PUNO2E6SeURH"},"outputs":[],"source":["def house_model(y_new):\n","    xs = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0])\n","    ys = np.array([1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5])\n","    \n","    # YOUR CODE HERE\n","\n","    # END CODE\n","\n","    return model.predict(y_new)[0]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"BvuVPQPC7N7q"},"outputs":[],"source":["prediction = house_model([7.0])\n","print(prediction)"]}],"metadata":{"coursera":{"course_slug":"introduction-tensorflow","graded_item_id":"jRjw8","launcher_item_id":"YoQKl"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.8"},"colab":{"name":"Exercise1-House_Prices_Question.ipynb","provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
